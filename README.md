# Hangman Game

Hangman is a classic word guessing game where one player thinks of a word, and another player tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts. This project implements the Hangman game in C++.

## Features

- Single Player Mode: The computer randomly selects a word, and the player tries to guess it.
- Multiplayer Mode: Player 1 enters a word for Player 2 to guess.
- Three Difficulty Levels: Choose from Easy, Medium, or Hard difficulty levels.
- Hint System: Players can use hints in Medium and Hard modes.
- Leaderboard: Keeps track of players' statistics and displays a leaderboard at the end.

## How to Play

2. Compile the C++ code using your preferred compiler.
     ```shell

3. Run the game

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game, enter your name, select the game mode, and choose the difficulty level.

## Game Rules
The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the word.
For each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman is drawn.
